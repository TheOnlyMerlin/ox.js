ox - Stubborn resources
=======================

Important Note
--------------
This project is entirely in the exploratory / conceptual phase and highly subject to change.

The Concept
-----------
Your javascript libraries are important to making sure your website acts exactly as it should.  You want to get the performance increase of using libraries hosted by providers such as Google, but the stability of hosting them locally.  
Ox will do everything it can to make sure your resources are loaded, at minimum performance hit. 

On top of that, it simplifies adding libraries, or collections of libraries into a single, short command.  For example: oxGet("jquery");
